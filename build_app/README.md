# xLab Workshop: Building Scalable Full-Stack AI Applications  

## 📌 Workshop Overview  
This workshop is designed to teach participants how to **architect and scale full-stack AI applications** by breaking down key concepts in **serving, compute, storage, and inference**. We will cover **scalability techniques** used in real-world production systems and then apply these concepts through a hands-on coding session.

## 🎓 What You Will Learn  
### 📖 Lecture Topics  
The lecture component will introduce the **four pillars of full-stack applications** and how to scale each:  
1. **Serve** – Deliver frontend applications faster using **CDNs, load balancing, and rate limiting**.  
2. **Compute** – Scale backend processing using **horizontal scaling, microservices, and message queues**.  
3. **Storage** – Improve performance with **caching (Redis, local disk, query caching)**.  
4. **Inference** – Deploy AI models at scale with **GPU inference and distributed AI processing**.  

🔹 We will also explore **real-world orchestration tools** like **Kubernetes, Kafka, and Terraform**, used by companies like **Amazon, Google, and ByteDance** to manage global-scale systems.

## 🛠️ Hands-On Coding Session  
In the second half of the workshop, participants will **build a mini full-stack AI application** using:  
✅ **Frontend** – A simple UI built with **Next.js**.  
✅ **Backend** – A lightweight API built using **Python + FastAPI**.  
✅ **Storage** – Caching with **Redis** to optimize performance.  
✅ **Network Gateway** – Using **NGINX** to route traffic efficiently.
